        <p>
            Australia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, comprising six states and ten territories.
            Australia's population of nearly 26 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard.
            Canberra is the nation's capital, while the largest cities are Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide.
             Australia's demography has been shaped by centuries of immigration, with immigrants accounting for 30% of the country's population,the highest proportion among major Western nations.</p>
